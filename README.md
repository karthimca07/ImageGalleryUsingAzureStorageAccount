# ImageGalleryUsingAzureStorageAccount
Image gallery application using C#NET, React JS, Azure storage account

Create an online image gallery application that allows users to upload, view, and manage images. 
The application will use Azure Storage accounts to store and serve the uploaded images. 
This project will give you hands-on experience with Azure Storage and its various services.

Key Features:
1. User Registration and Authentication: Implement user registration and authentication using Azure Active Directory or Azure AD B2C.
2. Image Upload: Allow users to upload images through a web interface. Use Azure Blob Storage to store the uploaded images.
3. Image Display: Display the uploaded images in a gallery format on the website. Retrieve and serve the images from Azure Blob Storage.
4. Image Metadata: Store metadata associated with each image, such as title, description, and upload date, in Azure Table Storage.
5. User-Specific Galleries: Create separate galleries for each user, allowing users to view and manage their own images.
6. Image Sharing: Implement the ability for users to share their images with others by generating secure URLs that grant temporary access to specific images.
7. Search and Tagging: Allow users to search for images based on tags or keywords. Store image tags in Azure Cosmos DB for efficient searching.
8. User Profiles: Develop user profiles where users can view and edit their information, including profile pictures stored in Azure Blob Storage.
9. Scaling and Performance: Optimize the application to handle different load levels and demonstrate how Azure Storage scales to accommodate increased demand.

Learning Opportunities:
• Setting up Azure Storage accounts, including Blob Storage, Table Storage, and Cosmos DB.
• Implementing user authentication and authorization with Azure AD or Azure AD B2C.
• Integrating Azure Storage services into a web application.
• Working with Azure SDKs and APIs to interact with Azure Storage.
• Designing and optimizing database schemas for image metadata and tags.
• Implementing secure image sharing mechanisms.
• Exploring Azure CDN for improving image delivery performance.
